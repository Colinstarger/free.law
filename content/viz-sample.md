We here at Free Law Project are happy to announce the launch of our Supreme Court Citation Network tool. Created in collaboration with the [SCOTUS Mapping Project](http://law.ubalt.edu/faculty/scotus-mapping/index.cfm) at the Univeristy of Baltimore, the tool permits users to create citation networks that represent "lines of cases" in Supreme Court doctrine. With the tool, users can also visualize, analyze, and share the networks they create.

Consider the network above. It was created with the tool and embedded directly into this post. Similar to a YouTube video, you can interact with it, hovering on the nodes to see the full case name, or clicking them to open them in a new tab. The visualization leverages [Supreme Court Database (Spaeth)](http://scdb.wustl.edu/about.php) to show a surprising fact about the recently departed Justice Scalia. He was a liberal on the Fourth Amendment. The map is anchored by two Scalia opinions in which he sided with the weed grower -- *Kyllo* (protecting weed grower from warrantless thermal imaging search) and *Jardines* (protecting weed grower from warrantless dog sniffing search).

While the nation debates Scalia's legacy, this network reminds us that Court doctrine is often more complicated than our stock labels suggest. The tool helps visualize this complexity.

We invite everyone to [try out our new tool](https://www.courtlistener.com/visualizations/scotus-mapper/) and see what kind of networks they can make. For examples of maps of SCOTUS doctrine already created with the tool, check out the [CourtListener Gallery](https://www.courtlistener.com/visualizations/gallery/), review a [Libguides Law Library Page](http://law.ubalt.libguides.com/content.php?pid=627751&sid=5223608), or check out a this [complete set of citation networks for 2014 Term](http://home.ubalt.edu/id86mp66/scotusmapper/Homepage_2014Term.html).

We look forward to hearing your feedback.
