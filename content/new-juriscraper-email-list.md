Quick post today to share that by popular demand, we've created YAEL --
Yet Another Email List. Today's list is one we should have made a while
back, and is for folks that work on the Juriscraper library. You can
find and add yourself to the list here:

<http://lists.freelawproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/juriscraper>

In general, this will be a normal list where we'll post any important
updates about Juriscraper, but this list will also get one special email
per day documenting the status of our 200+ court scrapers. Previously
this email was only sent privately to maintainers, but by making it
public, we're hoping to encourage more people to identify and fix the
day to day problems that arise with so many scrapers.

We look forward to lots more discussion and so much more scraping!
